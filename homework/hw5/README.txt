This is the fifth homework for Data-Structure Class. The program uses three algorithm: Kruskal, Prim, Dijkstra. The program finds the minimal cost spanning tree by using Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm, and finds the cost of the shortest path between two specified vertices by using Dijkstra's algorithm.

There are three parts in the program. The first part is using Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimal cost spanning tree. The second part is using Prim's algorithm to find the minimal cost spanning tree. The first and second parts will output the starting node and the ending node of an edge with its corresponding cost.

In the third part, the user will input the two number to find the cost of the shortest path between two specified vertices by using Dijkstra's algorithm.
